Description
===========

pccommand-listener is a Windows program written with Node.js and node-webkit. 

A Node.js HTTP server is used to receive and execute Windows command strings sent from Genie's STRPCCMD 
implementation or Profound UI's 'runPCCommand()' JavaScript API. node-webkit is used to provide native 
Windows UI features such as a system tray icon/menu, notifications, etc.

Required Dev Tools
==================

* Node.js
* Git
* Git Bash
* 7-Zip

The PATH environment must contain these: 

%programfiles%\nodejs;%programfiles%\Git\cmd;%programfiles%\Git\bin;%programfiles%\7-Zip

Getting Started
===============

I recommend using Git Bash shell, but Windows shell also works.

To clone the repo: 

  git clone "/p/Product Development/pccommand-listener.git" && cd pccommand-listener
  
To install required Node.js modules/packages (i.e. node-webkit):

  npm install && npm test
  
To run the program:

  npm start
  
To end the program: 

  Use the system tray menu option.
  
To see errors while coding:

  For the main window, edit the package.json and set the 'window' -> 'show' property to true.
  For the config window, set the 'toolbar' property to true in the 'window.open()' call in 'index.js'.
  
  This causes the browser window to display and you can use the toolbar to open the console.  
  
To build the distribution package:
  
  Edit the package.json and update the version number, then:
  
  npm build
